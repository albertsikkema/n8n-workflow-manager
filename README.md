## Installation

We are awaiting Chrome webstore admission, so until then install using one of these methods:

### Option 1: Install from Release (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/albertsikkema/n8n-workflow-manager/releases)
2. Download the latest `n8n-workflow-manager-v*.*.*.zip` file
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
4. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
6. Click **"Load unpacked"**
7. Select the extracted extension folder
8. The extension icon should appear in your toolbar

### Option 2: Install from Source

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertsikkema/n8n-workflow-manager.git
cd n8n-workflow-manager
```

Then follow steps 4-8 from Option 1 above.

## Setup

### n8n Configuration (Required)

1. Click the extension icon (‚öôÔ∏è) and select **"Options"**
2. Enter your n8n instance URL (e.g., `https://n8n.example.com`)
3. Generate an n8n API key:
   - Go to your n8n instance Settings ‚Üí API
   - Click **"Create API Key"**
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Chrome Extension")
   - Copy the key (it will only be shown once)
4. Paste the API key in the extension options
5. Click **"Test n8n Connection"** to verify
6. Click **"Save All Settings"**

**Note:** Credentials are stored in `chrome.storage.session` and cleared when you close your browser.

### GitHub Setup (Optional)

To enable GitHub integration for centralized backup and version control:

1. Click the extension icon and select **"Options"**
2. Enter your GitHub repository in the format: `owner/repo` (e.g., `myusername/n8n-backups`)
3. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to [GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
   - Give it a name (e.g., "n8n Workflow Manager")
   - Select the **`repo`** scope (required for private repositories)
   - Click **"Generate token"** and copy it
4. Paste the token in the extension options
5. Click **"Test GitHub Connection"** to verify
6. Click **"Save All Settings"**

Once configured, you'll see **"Backup to GitHub"** and **"Restore from GitHub"** buttons in the popup.

## Usage

> **üìç Important:** The extension only activates when you're viewing a workflow in n8n. The icon will turn **purple** when on a workflow page (URL contains `/workflow/`), and stay **gray** on other pages (like the settings or dashboard).

### Backup a Workflow

#### Option A: Backup to GitHub (Requires setup)
1. Navigate to a workflow in your n8n instance
2. Make sure you're on the workflow editor page (URL contains `/workflow/{workflowId}`)
3. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
4. Click **"Backup to GitHub"**
5. Enter a commit message (optional)
6. The workflow will be saved to: `workflows/{workflowId}.json`

#### Option B: Backup to File
1. Navigate to a workflow in your n8n instance
2. Make sure you're on the workflow editor page
3. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
4. Click **"Backup to File"**
5. Choose where to save the file
6. File will be saved as: `YYYYMMDD-HHmm-workflowname.json`

### Restore a Workflow

#### Option A: Restore from GitHub (Requires setup)
1. Navigate to the workflow you want to restore
2. Click the extension icon
3. Click **"Restore from GitHub"**
4. Select a workflow from the dropdown (defaults to current workflow)
5. Browse the commit history and select a version
6. Confirm the restore operation
7. The workflow will be updated immediately
8. Refresh the n8n page to see the changes

**Note:** You can restore from any workflow in your repository, not just the current one!

#### Option B: Restore from File
1. Navigate to the workflow you want to restore
2. Click the extension icon
3. Click **"Restore from File"**
4. Select your backup JSON file
5. Confirm the restore operation
6. The workflow will be updated immediately
7. Refresh the n8n page to see the changes

## How It Works

### n8n Integration
1. **Metadata Extraction**: Reads workflow ID from the n8n URL
2. **Authentication**: Uses your configured n8n API key
3. **Backup**: Makes a GET request to `{n8n-url}/api/v1/workflows/{id}`
4. **Restore**: Makes a PUT request to update the workflow definition
5. **Data Cleaning**: Removes instance-specific fields (credentials, webhookId, timestamps)

### GitHub Integration (Optional)
1. **Configuration**: Stores GitHub PAT and repository in `chrome.storage.session`
2. **Backup**: Creates/updates files at `workflows/{workflowId}.json` with commit messages
3. **Restore**: Fetches commit history, allows workflow and version selection, retrieves workflow JSON from specific commit
4. **Security**: All API calls made directly from browser, tokens never logged or transmitted elsewhere

## Requirements

- Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 support)
- Active n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- n8n API key with workflow read/write permissions
- (Optional) GitHub account with Personal Access Token for GitHub integration

## API Endpoints Used

### n8n REST API (v1)
- **GET** (Backup): `/api/v1/workflows/{id}` - Retrieve workflow definition
- **PUT** (Restore): `/api/v1/workflows/{id}` - Update workflow definition

### GitHub REST API
- **GET** `/repos/{owner}/{repo}` - Validate repository access
- **GET** `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/workflows` - List all workflows
- **GET** `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}` - Get file SHA for updates
- **PUT** `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}` - Create/update workflow files
- **GET** `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?path={path}` - List commit history

## Troubleshooting

### "Not on a workflow page"
- Make sure you're on the workflow editor page
- The URL should contain `/workflow/YOUR-WORKFLOW-ID`
- Try refreshing the page

### "No n8n API key configured"
- Go to Options and configure your n8n instance URL and API key
- Click "Test n8n Connection" to verify
- Make sure the API key has workflow permissions

### Backup/Restore fails with 401 Unauthorized
- Your API key is invalid or has expired
- Check the API key in the Options page
- Create a new API key in n8n if needed

### Backup/Restore fails with 403 Forbidden
- Your API key doesn't have permission to access this workflow
- Make sure the API key has appropriate permissions in n8n

### GitHub options not showing
- Make sure you've configured GitHub in the Options page
- Check that your token has the `repo` scope
- Verify the repository format is `owner/repo`

### GitHub backup/restore fails
- Verify your GitHub token hasn't expired
- Check that you have write access to the repository
- Ensure the repository exists and is accessible
- Check your internet connection
- Look at browser console (F12) for detailed error messages

### "Credentials must be reconfigured" warning after restore
- This is normal - n8n credentials are instance-specific
- You must manually reconfigure credentials in n8n after restore
- Credential IDs and webhook IDs are removed during restore
